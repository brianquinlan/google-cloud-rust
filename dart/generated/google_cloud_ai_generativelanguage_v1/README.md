## What's this?

The Google Cloud client library for the Generative Language API.

The Gemini API allows developers to build generative AI applications using
Gemini models. Gemini is our most capable model, built from the ground up
to be multimodal. It can generalize and seamlessly understand, operate
across, and combine different types of information including language,
images, audio, video, and code. You can use the Gemini API for use cases
like reasoning across text and images, content generation, dialogue
agents, summarization and classification systems, and more.

## Quickstart

The main clients for this package are:

- `GenerativeService`
- `ModelService`
